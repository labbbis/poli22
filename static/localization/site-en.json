    "what-poli": "Polin Appro is a legendary pub crawl in the city centre of Helsinki, organized by the Hosts and Hostesses (IE) of the Aalto University Student Union. The pub crawl is located around Vanha Poli, the origins of engineering students, limiting the area from Punavuori to Kamppi. In all the previous years, the party has been incredible when a crowd of students and student-minded people regardless of their degree have taken over the streets of Helsinki. Unlike other pub crawls, Polin Appro changes every year. The theme of 2021 appro is the goddess of hunting, night sky and the moon, Artemis. Decorate yourself and your overalls accordingly and head off to the night to hunt (bars) like Artemis.",
    "what-appro-header": "What is appro?",
    "what-appro": "The idea of the appro is to visit the pubs marked in the appro ticket and collect drink stamps. You get an overall badge at the afterparty depending on the number of stamps that you have collected during the evening. After the pub crawl, you can head to Apollo Live Club to the official afterparty. Free admission with the appro ticket.",
